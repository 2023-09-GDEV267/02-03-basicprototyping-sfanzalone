# Module1-Projects
 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

My goal in making this project was not only to learn and understand the starter projects
within Gibson Bond's book, but to also incorporate the elements I learned up to this point,
and make them into my own working prototype.

In relation to my prototype, specifically, it's simple, but it incorporates the use of
pickups and a rolling ball as the player, coming from the Roll-a-Ball Project, and a
moving goal, which takes a portion of elements from the ApplePicker Project.  And to
end it off, the console will tell you that you won the moment the player game object
lands on the goal.
